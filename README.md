# CatJack

A blackjack game with a cat theme to it.

Home screen prompts the user to login. It has a custom image generated by AI and in the background you hear music playing which can be muted using the mute button top left. The application can be closed at any time using the button top right. All the buttons in the application have a custom sound when they are pressed. The users mouse also uses a custom cursor which looks like a cat paw and changes depending on if it is in its default position or if it is pointing at a button that can be clicked.

Once the login button is pressed a window will pop up prompting the user to enter their details or register. The details are stored on the internet in a Firebase database.

This is how the registration page looks like, the user has a choice between many different cat avatars for their profile picture.

Here is the structure for the Firebase daatbase and some examples of users that were created.

Once logged in the user can begin a singleplayer game where they can see the following window open. Here the player is always at the player 2 position and there are 2 AI players with random profile pictures that will play at the table alongside the player. The next step is to place a bet which can be done using the slider. The users current credits are displayed bottom right.

After the bet is placed the dealer will begin slowly dealing cards to each player, it slowly deals the cards using timers, when a card is dealt it also plays a sound similar to when you deal a card in real life. After all cards is dealt then the label above the cards will change depending what cards is in the players hand (aces count as 11 if it wont bust the player, and 1 if it will bust the player). The dealers second card is still face down until the round ends, so their current score is just for their 1 card that is showing. its important to note that once a card is dealt from the 1 deck of cards, it wont be able to be dealt again until the round finishes and the dealer shuffles the deck again. The player can now decide if they want to Hit or if they want to Stand.

If the player Hits it will simulate an animation, using timers, for moving the card over and the dealer dealing another card. Then it will update the new score taking into account the full hand which will now be 3 cards. It also correctly adjusts for aces. The player can Hit as many times as they want but as soon as they get either a blackjack or a bust they cannot Hit anymore. In the previous image my hand was 16, then I hit and received a 6 causing me to bust which can be seen in the next image.

Now the users only option is to stand, which will immediately lead to the AI players playing out their turns, they have the same options as the user in the sense of they can either Hit or Stand, but they can only Hit a maximum of 3 times because of my limitations with timers. The AI makes its decisions base off of the strategy described on this website https://www.blackjackapprenticeship.com/blackjack-strategy-charts/ once their turns is finished the dealer will reveal their second card which will decide if the player wins or not. If the player wins then they will receive 1.5x their bet, if they lose then they lose 2x their bet, the new credit value will then be updated and edited on the database. The round is over then, and the slider will appear again to start the next round. Here is an image of when the round is over and the player has lost.
